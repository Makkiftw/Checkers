# Checkers - 2020

## Description
Small game written in ruby. The project began in March 2020 and was finished the 22nd June 2020. 
Finally decided to upload this on Github, and also made a few final tweaks.

Checkers is a turn-based game. The goal is to move your (red) pieces to the other side of the board, faster than your opponent can move his.
Pieces can also jump over each other; use this to your advantage.
